# Welcome to my portfolio
Hello, World! This site was brought to you by React, Sass, and a lot of Stack Overflow.

If for some reason you'd like to run this yourself (don't worry, I won't judge you), you'll need have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) installed. You can also optionally install [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) (to add vendor prefixes like `-webkit`). Once you've done that, run `npm install` to install the [required dependencies](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/blob/develop/package.json#L6) then run `npm run compile-sass` to generate the necessary css files. If you've installed autoprefixer and postcss, run `npm run prefix-css` instead to compille the scss to css and then prefix that css. Once the dependencies are installed and the sass is compiled run `npm start` to start the development server.
