# Welcome to my portfolio
Hello, World! This site was brought to you by React, Sass, and a lot of Stack Overflow.

If for some reason you'd like to run this yourself (don't worry, I won't judge you), you'll need have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. If it's installed, run `npm install` to install the [required dependencies](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/blob/develop/package.json#L6) then run `npm run build` to build the project. Once the build is finished, run `npm start` and head to localhost on your browser.
