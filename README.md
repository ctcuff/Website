# Welcome to my portfolio
Hello, World! This site was brought to you by Vue.

This site's been through a few transformations. I generally try to redesign the site once in a while to try and improve my design skills. This project started as a one page website barely held together with jQuery/Bootstrap and eventually snowballed into a site barely held together with Vue and SCSS. Here are some of the previous revisions:

- [Original (jQuery and Bootstrap)](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/tree/vanilla-js)
- [Revision I. (terminal theme)](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/tree/terminal-theme)
- [Revision II. (React version of original)](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/tree/develop)
- [Revision III. (Vue redesign)](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/tree/vue)
- [Revision VI. (Current)](https://github.com/ctcuff/ctcuff.github.io/tree/dev/2020)

If for some reason you'd like to build this yourself, run:
1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`
